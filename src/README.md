README: 
This project takes an audio file input (either mp3 or wav) and provides access to a slew of information, such as the waveform plot, RT60 differences, the length of the file, etc. This exists to help a user analyze their audio file, and the analysis can be used for things such as determine how to best architectually design a building in the future based on the data recorded from a pre-existing building. To use the program, run the controller, once the GUI has appeared click the 'load file' button and select either an mp3 or wav file, then click any of the other buttons to display their information.
